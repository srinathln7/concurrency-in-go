# Worker Pool pattern

This Go code implements a worker pool with a fixed number of goroutines that concurrently process tasks. The `WorkerPool` struct manages the pool of worker goroutines, which are initialized with a specified capacity. Each worker goroutine runs a function that continuously fetches tasks from a shared channel and executes them. The `AddTask` method is used to submit tasks to the pool, and the `Wait` method ensures that all tasks are completed before closing the program. In the `main` function, a worker pool is created with a capacity of 5, and 20 tasks are submitted to it. Each task simply prints its ID and simulates work with a one-second sleep. The program waits for all tasks to be processed before terminating, ensuring efficient and controlled concurrent execution.
